  Federated Learning (FL) distributes the computational load of machine learning while preserving privacy by keeping sensitive data on the client devices instead of a centralized server.

## FL with Oakestra
The main target group for (cross-device) FL is heterogeneous edge devices.
Oakestra specializes in handling such resource-constrained devices spread across various geographical areas.
Infrastructure providers can have their own isolated cluster and cluster orchestrator - (ideal for cross-silo FL).
Cluster orchestrators can only access detailed information about workers from their cluster.
The metrics they share with the root are distilled and no longer contain sensitive individual metadata.
This is an ideal environment for FL because this layout supports privacy on a structural level.
Oakestra's lean open-source code base allows for easy extension, further development, and experimentation with FL features.

## FLOps Addon
FLOps is an [Oakestra Addon](/docs/concepts/oakestra-extensions/addons/) that enables streamlined and accelerated practical FL workflows through many of its automation features.

{{< callout context="note" title="Designed for Change" icon="outline/target-arrow" >}}
  FLOps aims to be easily modifiable and extendable by developers and researchers.
  FLOps employs the following techniques to strive for high code quality and flexibility:
  - Use state-of-the-art libraries and frameworks
  - Extendable CLI
  - Ready-made extendable multi-platform images and services to automate development and evaluation workflows.
  - Additional base images with optional development flags to speed up the build and execution times.
  - Enforcement of proper styling and typing via formatters and linters, including CI.

{{< details "**Automated FL Augmentation/Containerization**" >}}
  FLOps allows users to perform FL by simply providing a link to their machine learning (ML) Git repository.
  This repository code needs to satisfy some simple structural prerequisites.
  It gets automatically augmented by FLOps to support FL.
  FLOps creates a containerized image with all necessary dependencies to do FL training.
  These images are automatically built and adhere to best practices, ensuring they are as fast and lightweight as possible.
  FLOps can build these images for multiple different target platforms.
  Thus, FL components can run on ARM edge devices like Raspberry Pis or Nvidia Jetsons.
  FLOps enables FL on all devices that support containerization technologies like Docker or containerd.
  This approach eliminates the need for tedious device setup and the struggle to configure heterogeneous dependencies to match the training requirements.

{{< details "**Automated Orchestration of FL Components and Auxiliaries**" >}}
  FLOps automatically performs FL training based on the user-requested configuration, such as:
  - Resource Requirements
  - Number of Training Rounds
  - The FL Algorithm/Method
  - Minimum Number of Learners
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "**Elevated Observability & Tracking via MLOps**" >}}
  During runtime, users can observe this training process via a sophisticated GUI, which allows users to monitor, compare, store, export, share, and organize training runs, metrics, and trained models.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "**Accessible Inference Serving**" >}}
  FLOps can automatically build inference servers based on the trained model.
  This inference server can be pulled as a regular image.
  FLOps can also directly deploy this trained-model image as an inference server on Oakestra worker nodes.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "**Combine latest Frameworks & Tools**" >}}
  FLOps combines state-of-the-art solutions from different fields in novel ways instead of reinventing custom subpar solutions from scratch.
  To the best of our knowledge, FLOps is the first work that combines Flower with MLflow, allows hierarchical FL, and automatically converts ML code into FL-enabled containerized images.

  Every third-party component and dependency has been carefully analyzed and compared with possible alternatives.
  The following is a selection of tools and frameworks that power FLOps.

  ### Flower
  [Flower](https://flower.ai/) is the leading research-backed open-source FL framework on the market.
  Due to Flower’s high flexibility and customization, FLOps was able to combine it with other tools and its own components to achieve novel features.
  Flower implements and handles core FL components, but it does not handle many other necessary aspects such as deployment, orchestration, dependency management, containerization, or advanced tracking and observability tools seen in MLOps.

  ### mlflow
  [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is a mature open-source MLOps tool that powers the runtime observability and tracking features of FLOps.
  MLflow augments and supports the entire ML lifecycle, from conception, to code and dependency archivation and unification, tracking and tagging ML models and artifacts, and re-deployments.

  ### Apache's 'Data Suite'
  FLOps works with real data on learner devices.
  Several technologies provided by [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) are employed to efficiently receive, store, and retrieve such data.
  - [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html) columnar format for working with data in memory.
  - [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) columnar file format for working with data stored on disk.
  - [Arrow Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html) a gRPC-based framework to transport Apache formatted data over the network.

  ### Buildah
  [Buildah](https://buildah.io/) helps FLOps to build containerized FL images inside running containers.
  Therefore distributing the computational load of image building across devices.

  ### Anaconda Suite
  FLOps uses the [Anaconda Suite](https://docs.anaconda.com/) to resolve dependencies to provide equal ML training across devices.
  To be more specific:
   - [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) for lightweight (base) images
   - [Mamba](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community) for fast dependency resolving

{{< /details >}}

{{< details "**Convenient Installation & native CLI**" >}}
  FLOps can be easily set up by cloning its [repository](https://github.com/oakestra/addon-FLOps) and running the docker-compose file on the same machine as the Oakestra Root Orchestrator.
  See the [FLOps Manuals](/docs/manuals/flops-addon/overview/) for concrete instructions.

  The [Oakestra CLI](/docs/getting-started/deploy-app/deploy-cli/) supports a [set of commands](/docs/reference/cli/oak_addon_flops/) to work with FLOps.
{{< /details >}}

As a result, individuals with different levels of expertise in FL, automation, DevOps, containerization, and orchestration can benefit from these techniques and perform FL.

{{< callout context="note" title="Naming Explained" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
  **FLOps** stands for *Federated Learning Operations*.
  It is inspired by the field of *MLOps* that enhances ML with DevOps practices.

### Simplified Architecture

{{<svg "flops_overview">}}

FLOps’ architecture/workflow consists of the following parts:
- The user interacts with the FLOps API (directly or via the `oak-cli`), the deployed FL tracking server/GUI, and the inference server.
- The FLOps management suite acts as a dedicated separate control plane as well as storage for container images and trained results, metrics, metadata, and ML models.
- The ML code that gets FL-augmented and used for training must be provided as a Git repository.
- The FLOps management deploys its required components with the help of Oakestra as services on worker nodes.
- The different computational components (e.g., learners, container image builders, etc.) are scaled up and distributed among various worker nodes.
