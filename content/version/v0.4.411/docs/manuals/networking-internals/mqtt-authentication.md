## Intra-Cluster Communication

{{<svg-small "mqtt-arch">}}

The above image shows how intra-cluster communication takes place. Nodes send application status and node health reports to the cluster-service-manager.
The cluster-service-manager then appropriately propagates this information to other nodes and the root-service-manager. Since the nodes report sensitive information, such
as IP Addresses, we highly recommend securing the MQTT channels.

{{< callout context="note" title="MQTT" icon="outline/info-circle">}} 
MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol that supports publishing/subscribing to named channels. Oakestra uses MQTT due to its minimal network usage and low processing overhead. More information at [mqtt.org](https://mqtt.org/).

## MQTTS
MQTT supports exchanging certificates to establish a TLS-secured channel. For this, the server (MQTT Broker) and every client require a certificate-key file pair signed against the same certificate Authority (CA). The MQTT broker can be configured to only accept incoming secured connections and to identify devices by their certificate common name (CN) entry.

### Configuring the Cluster Manager


Navigate into the `cluster_orchestrator` directory in the oakestra repository.

1. Configure the MQTT Broker by adding the following lines to the `mosquitto/mosquitto.conf` file:
    ```yaml
    cafile /certs/ca.crt
    certfile /certs/server.crt
    keyfile /certs/server.key

    require_certificate true
    use_identity_as_username true
    ```
2. Generate the certificates in the `./certs` directory
    * **MQTTS (Server):**
       1. Generate CA authority key:
          ```bash
          openssl req -new -x509 -days <duration> -extensions v3_ca -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt
          ```
       2. Generate a server key:
          ```bash
          openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
          ```
       3. Generate a certificate signing request including the URL as a SAN:
          ```bash
          openssl req -out server.csr -key server.key -new -addext "subjectAltName = IP:${SYSTEM_MANAGER_URL}, DNS:mqtts"
          ```
            When prompted for the CN, enter `mqtts`
       4. Send the CSR to the CA:
           ```bash
           openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days <duration> -copy_extensions copyall
           ```
       5. Grant permissions to read the server keyfile:
            ```bash 
            chmod 0644 server.key
            ```
    * **Cluster Manager (Client):**
        1. Generate a client key:
            ```bash
            openssl genrsa -aes256 -out cluster.key 2048
            ```
        2. Generate a certificate signing request:
            ```bash
            openssl req -out cluster.csr -key cluster.key -new
            ```
            When prompted for the CN, enter `cluster_manager`
        3. Send the CSR to the CA:
            ```bash
            openssl x509 -req -in cluster.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out cluster.crt -days <duration>
            ```
        4. Export the keyfile password as an environment variable:
            ```bash
            export CLUSTER_KEYFILE_PASSWORD=<keyfile password>
            ```
    * **Cluster Service Manager (Client):**
        1. Generate a client key:
            ```bash
            openssl genrsa -aes256 -out cluster_net.key 2048
            ```
        2. Generate a certificate signing request:
            ```bash
            openssl req -out cluster_net.csr -key cluster_net.key -new
            ```
            When prompted for the CN, enter `cluster_service_manager`
        3. Send the CSR to the CA:
            ```bash
            openssl x509 -req -in cluster_net.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out cluster_net.crt -days <duration>
            ```
        4. Export the keyfile password as an environment variable:
            ```bash
            export CLUSTER_SERVICE_KEYFILE_PASSWORD=<keyfile password>
            ```

3. Deploy the cluster with the MQTTS override
    ```bash
    sudo -E docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f override-mosquitto-auth.yml
    ```

### Configuring a Node
<!--- Subject to change when NodeEngine and NetManager are demonized -->

1. Copy the `ca.crt` and `ca.key` files to the worker node.
2. Generate the certificates
   1. Generate a client key:
       ```bash
       openssl genrsa -aes256 -out client.key 2048
       ```
   2. Generate a certificate signing request:
       ```bash
       openssl req -out client.csr -key client.key -new
       ```
       When prompted for the CN, enter the public IP of the machine
   3. Send the CSR to the CA:
       ```bash
       openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA <path to ca file> -CAkey <path to ca key file> -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days <duration>
       ```
   4. Decrypt the keyfile:
        ```bash
        openssl rsa -in client.key -out unencrypt_client.key
        ```
   5. Tell your OS to trust the certificate authority by placing the ca.crt file in the `/etc/ssl/certs/` directory
3. Run the NodeEngine:
    ```bash
    sudo NodeEngine -n 0 -p 10100 -a <SYSTEM_MANAGER_URL> -c <path to client.crt> -k <path to unencrypt_client.key>
    ```
4. **(Optional)** Configure the NetManager:
    1. Edit the `/etc/netmanager/netcfg.json` file so that the `"MqttCert"` and `"MqttKey"` fields specify the path to the node certificate and key files (The NetManager should use the same certificate-keyfile pair as the NodeEngine)
    2. Run the NetManager:
        ```bash
        sudo NetManager -p 6000
        ```
    3. Run the NodeEngine:
        ```bash
        sudo NodeEngine -n 6000 -p 10100 -a <SYSTEM_MANAGER_URL> -c <path to client.crt> -k <path to unencrypt_client.key>
        ```

{{< callout context="note" title="Did you know?" icon="outline/rocket">}} The [Oakestra automation repository](https://github.com/oakestra/automation)
contains many useful scripts such as ones for [creating MQTTS certificate files](https://github.com/oakestra/automation/tree/d43f701134fdf71e1206532883006e1937c38ef9/development_cluster_management/generate_mqtts_certificates). {{< /callout >}}

### Finishing up

Let's check if all the components succesfully registered with the MQTT Broker via TLS.
1. **Cluster Manager:** Check the docker compose logs with
    ```bash
    docker compose logs | grep cluster_manager
    docker compose logs | grep cluster_service_manager
    ```
    Look for the  following lines:
    ```yaml
    service_manager - INFO - MQTT - TLS configured
    cluster_manager - INFO - MQTT - TLS configured
    ```
2. **Node:** Both the NodeEngine and NetManager should display the following log line after execution:
    ```yaml
    MQTT - Configuring TLS
    ```

If everything looks good then Congrats 🎉, your MQTT channels are now secured! When adding any further components, be sure to always give them a unique CN, as this is used to identify the device.
