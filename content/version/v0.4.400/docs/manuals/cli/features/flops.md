Oakestra supports addons via its addon marketplace.

The FLOps addon enables practical application-oriented federated machine learning.
It automates ML/FL duties for the user by building on top of DevOps and MLOps concepts, including:

- Handling the setup and configuration of the ML environment by building multi-platform container images.
- Scheduling and handling FL learners and aggregators - performing the FL training.
- State-of-the-art observability capabilities via a modern browser-based GUI.
- Providing the trained model for pulling and automatic deployment as an inference server.
- Allow users to customize their FL by specifying various aspects ranging from training rounds to their FL strategy.

Note that FLOps is not yet available in the marketplace.

The `oak-cli` acts as an interface to the FLOps addon.

Typing out `oak addon flops ...` every time can be cumbersome, even with tab-autocompletion enabled.
You can create an alias to run FLOps oak-CLI commands more quickly.

For example, add `alias oaf="oak addon flops"` to your `/etc/bash.bashrc` file.

Now you can run all FLOps commands like this: `oaf ...`
