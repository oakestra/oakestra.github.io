## Deploy Multiple Clusters

Having one root orchestrator and one cluster orchestrator on one device is a great way to start using Oakestra, but the true power
of the system lies in it's federated architecture.

This guide will walk you through deploying stand-alone components, allowing you to
deploy multiple cluster orchestrators across multiple devices. These clusters will be managed by a single root orchestrator.

### Stand-alone Root Orchestrator

{{<svg "architecture/Arch-Root">}}

First, let's deploy a stand-alone root orchestrator. This component will manage your clusters and provide an interface for users to interact with the Oakestra setup
by providing an [API](../../getting-started/deploy-app/with-the-api/) and a [dashboard](../../getting-started/deploy-app/with-the-dashboard/).

```bash
curl -sfL oakestra.io/install-root.sh | sh -
```

This script will download the required files to the directory `~/oakestra/root_orchestrator`. From there it will build the root orchestrator.

If you run into a restricted network (e.g., on a cloud VM) you need to configure the firewall rules and the NetManager component accordingly. Please refer to: [Firewall Setup](../firewall-configuration)

### Stand-alone Cluster Orchestrator

{{<svg "architecture/Arch-Cluster">}}

Next, we can deploy a stand-alone cluster orchestrator. This component will manage the nodes by delegating applications, creating subnetworks and
facilitating communication. Additionally the cluster orchestrator sends aggregated reports to the root orchestrator.

```bash
curl -sfL oakestra.io/install-cluster.sh | sh -
```

This script will download the required files to the directory `~/oakestra/cluster_orchestrator`. From there it will walk you through
configuring the cluster. Once the setup is complete, it will build the cluster orchestrator and register with the root orchestrator.

{{< callout context="danger" title="Watch out!" icon="outline/alert-octagon" >}}
The root orchestrator has to be reachable by the cluster orchestrator. When not on the same network the root orchestrator URL has to be a public
address!
{{< /callout >}}

You can register as many cluster orchestrators with the root orchestrator as you would like. Repeat the above commmand on a new device and specify
a unique `Cluster Name` and `Cluster Location`.

## Custom Deployments

Oakestra also allows you to customize your system deployment to best suit your needs.

Check out [addons](../extending-oakestra/creating-addons) for even more customization options!

### Choose a Different Branch

By default these scripts will compose the services of the `main` oakestra branch, the latest stable release. However this can be changed by setting the environment variable `OAKESTRA_BRANCH` <u>before running the startup script</u>.
This allows you to experiment with some unreleased features.

```bash
export OAKESTRA_BRANCH=develop
```

This will allow you to use the services from the alpha Oakestra release.

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
Oakestra has many features which have not yet been released. You can check out what's in the pipeline by taking a look at some of the active [branches](https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra/branches) here.

### Compose Overrides

Since Oakestra uses docker-compose to build the components, we can use overrides to fine-tune our build environment.

To use the override files, specify the them in a comma-seperated list by setting the `OVERRIDE_FILES` env variable <u>before running the startup script</u>.

```bash
export OVERRIDE_FILES=override-alpha-versions.yaml
```
