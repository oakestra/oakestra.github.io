The addons system consists of two subsystems that must both be running:

- The addons engine
- The addons marketplace

## Run the Addons System

To use the addons engine and the marketplace, you need to enable them before starting up your Oakestra root orchestrator. To enable these components at cluster startup, you need to export the following _override file_ before using the startup command:

```bash
 export OVERRIDE_FILES=override-addons.yaml
```

To start a single machine root and cluster orchestrator with the addons engine and the marketplace enabled, you can use:

```bash
 export OVERRIDE_FILES=override-addons.yaml
 curl -sfL oakestra.io/getstarted.sh | sh -
```

**Or** for a standalone root orchestrator with the addons engine and marketplace enabled, you can use:

```bash
export OVERRIDE_FILES=override-addons.yaml
curl -sfL oakestra.io/install-root.sh | sh -
```

The environment variable `OVERRIDE_FILES` is used at Oakestra startup to customize the services composing the control plane. These files are simple docker compose files integrated into Oakestra via the [override](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/multiple-compose-files/merge/) functionality.

This should spin up 3 docker containers inside the `root-orchestrator`. Notice that it also starts up the addons marketplace locally.
