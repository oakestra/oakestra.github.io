Let's get you up to speed with the easiest possible setup. You'll be able to run your first Oakestra Orchestrator in a few seconds!

{{< callout context="note" title="Did you know?" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
You can install all required dependencies for Oakestra setup on your machine using the `oak-cli`. Simply use the command

```bash
oak i fundamentals
```

Learn more about installing the `oak-cli` in the [CLI Setup](../../deploy-app/deploy-cli/) page.

### Startup the Orchestrators in a Single Machine

In this guide, we'll perform a Single Machine Setup. This setup is the easiest way to get started with Oakestra with a single Cluster managed by a single machine. To do so, we'll install the **Root Orchestrator** and the **Cluster Orchestrator** together, as shown in the following figure.

After the orchestrators are up and running, you can add Edge Devices as workers to your cluster (see: [Add Edge Devices (Workers) to Your Setup](../your-first-worker/)).

You can install the **Root** and **Cluster Orchestrator** in a single machine using the following command:

```bash
curl -sfL oakestra.io/getstarted.sh | sh -
```

This command downloads and runs the Oakestra's docker compose files in `~/oakestra` folder.

{{< callout context="note" title="Did you know?" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
You can set a multi-cluster infrastructure by installing each **Cluster Orchestrator** on a different machine.
Check out [Advanced Oakestra Clusters Setup](../../../manuals/advanced-cluster-setup/) section for more details.

If you run into a restricted network (e.g., on a cloud VM) you need to configure the firewall rules and the NetManager component accordingly. Please refer to: [Firewall Setup](../../../manuals/firewall-configuration)  
{{< /callout >}}

If the startup succeeds, **congratulations! 🎉🎉**
You're now ready to add your first worker node to your cluster (see: [Add Edge Devices (Workers) to Your Setup](../your-first-worker/)).

### Shutdown the Components

To stop your **Root & Cluster** orchestrator components run:

```bash
docker compose -f ~/oakestra/1-DOC.yaml down
```
