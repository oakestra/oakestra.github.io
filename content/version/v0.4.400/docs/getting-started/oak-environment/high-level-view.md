Oakestra lets you deploy your workload on devices of any size, from a small RasperryPi to a cloud instance far away on GCP or AWS. The tree structure enables you to create multiple clusters of resources.

- The **Root Orchestrator** manages different clusters of resources. The root only sees aggregated cluster resources.
- The **Cluster Orchestrator** manages your worker nodes. This component collects real-time resources and schedules your workloads to the perfect matching device.
- A **Worker** is where your workloads are executed. E.g., your containers.

{{< callout context="note" title="Did you know?" icon="outline/rocket">}} Since the stable Accordion release, Oakestra supports both containers and unikernel virtualization targets. {{< /callout >}}
