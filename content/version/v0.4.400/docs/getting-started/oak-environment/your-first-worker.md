### Add a Worker Node to your Cluster

If you have a running **Root Orchestrator** and at least one **Cluster Orchestrator** you can add a new worker node to your cluster.

{{< svg "deploy-worker" >}}

First, you need to install your **Worker Node** components on every Edge Device you want to use as a worker running:

```bash
curl -sfL oakestra.io/install-worker.sh | sh -
```

{{< callout context="caution" title="Worker Node Requirements" icon="outline/alert-triangle">}}
Check out the system requirements for the **Worker Node** in the [System Requirements](../high-level-setup-overview) section.
{{< /callout >}}

Each worker node must be attached to a running **Cluster Orchestrator**. To do so, you need to know the IP address of the Cluster Orchestrator you want to connect to.

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}} You can obtain the public IPv4 address of your device with

```bash
curl -4 https://ifconfig.co
```

{{< /callout >}}

Then, startup each **Worker Node** using the following command:

```bash
sudo NodeEngine -a <IP address of your cluster orchestrator> -d
```

{{< callout context="note" title="Note" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
the `-d` flag runs the NodeEngine in background (detached mode)
{{< /callout >}}

Check if your worker is running, and that it's correctly registered to your cluster:

```bash
sudo NodeEngine status
```

If everything is showing up green 🟢... Congratulations, your worker node is set up! 🎉

You can check the NodeEngine logs using

```bash
sudo NodeEngine logs
```

If you run into a restricted network (e.g., on a cloud VM) you need to configure the firewall rules and the NetManager component accordingly. Please refer to: [Firewall Setup](../../../manuals/firewall-configuration)

### Shutdown a Worker

To stop a worker node, use:

```bash
sudo NodeEngine stop
```
