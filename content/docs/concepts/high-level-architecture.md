{{< callout context="tip" title="Did you know?" icon="outline/rocket" >}}
Oakestra is composed of *three* key building blocks:
* The [Root Orchestrator](#root-orchestrator): the master orchestrator of the infrastructure. 
* The [Cluster Orchestrator](#cluster-orchestrator): a local orchestrator directly managing the workers. 
* The [Worker Node](#worker-node) machine that executes application microservices.
{{< /callout >}}

## Root Orchestrator

The root orchestrator is the centralized control plane that coordinates the participating clusters.

{{< svg "orchestration/arch-root" >}}

The image above illustrates the components of the root orchestrator. Each component operates as an independent service, integrated and managed using the Docker Compose plugin.

* The **System Manager** serves as the primary interface for users to access the system as an application deployment platform. It provides two sets of APIs:
  1. To receive deployment commands from users via [CLI](../../getting-started/deploy-app/deploy-cli/), [Dashboard](../../getting-started/deploy-app/deploy-dashboard/), or directly via [REST API](/docs/reference/api/deploy-api/).
  2. To handle child Oakestra Clusters.

* The **Root Network Component** manages Semantic IP and Instance IP addresses for each service and the cluster's subnetworks. Refer to the Networking [concepts](../networking) and [manuals](../../manuals/networking-internals/load-balancing/) for more details.

* The **Addons Engine** manages custom resources, hooks, plugins and extensions that enable flexible customizations to the system. Read more on [extending Oakestra](../oakestra-extensions/addons) here.


## Cluster Orchestrator

{{< svg "orchestration/arch-cluster" >}}

The cluster orchestrator functions as a logical twin of the root orchestrator but differs in the following ways:

* **Worker Management:** Unlike the root orchestrator, the cluster orchestrator manages worker nodes instead of clusters.

* **Resource Aggregation:** The cluster orchestrator aggregates resources from its worker nodes and abstracts the cluster's internal composition to the root orchestrator. At the root level, a cluster appears as a generic resource with a total capacity equal to the sum of its worker node resources.

* **Intra-Cluster Communication:** MQTT is used as the communication protocol for the intra-cluster control plane.


## Worker Node

The **worker node** is the component responsible for executing workloads requested by developers. 

A worker node is any Linux machine running two essential services:

* **NodeEngine**: Manages the deployment of applications based on the installed runtimes.  
* **NetManager**: Provides the networking components required for seamless inter-application communication.

{{< svg "orchestration/arch-node-engine" >}}

{{< details "The **Node Engine** is a single binary implemented using `Go`. *Click to learn about its modules*." >}}
* **MQTT:** Acts as the communication interface between the worker and the cluster. It handles deployment commands, node status updates, and job updates by transmitting and receiving data.

* **Models:** Define the structure of nodes and jobs:
  * **Node:** Represents the resources reported to the cluster. These are divided into:
    * *Static resources*—transmitted only during startup (e.g., hardware configuration).
    * *Dynamic resources*—periodically updated (e.g., CPU and memory usage).
  * **Service:** Represents the services managed by the worker node, including real-time service usage statistics.

* **Jobs:** Background processes that monitor the health and status of the worker node and its deployed applications.

* **Runtimes:** Supported system runtimes for workload execution. Currently, containers and unikernels are supported.

* **Net API:** A local socket interface used for communication with the Net Manager.

<!-- The **Node Engine** is a single binary implemented using Go and is composed of the following modules:
* **MQTT:** The interface between the worker and the cluster. Deployment commands, node status
updates, and job updates are pushed and received with this component.
* **Models:** Models that describe the nodes and jobs  
    * Node: Describes the resources that are transmitted to the cluster. These are decomposed into static resources, which are only transmitted at startup, and dynamic resources, which are periodically updated, e.g. CPU/memory
    * Service: Describes the services that are managed by this worker node, as well as the real-time
 service usage statistics
* **Jobs:** Background jobs that monitor the status of the worker node and the deployed applications
* **Runtimes:** The supported system runtimes. Currently, containers and Unikernels are supported
* **Net API:** local socket used to interact with the Net Manager. -->

{{< details "The **Net Manager** is responsible for managing service-to-service communication within and across nodes. It handles tasks such as fetching balancing policies for each service, setting up virtual network interfaces, balancing traffic, and tunneling packets across nodes. *Click to learn about its modules*." >}}

* **Environment Manager:** Handles the installation of virtual network interfaces, network namespaces, and iptables rules.

* **Proxy:** Manages traffic balancing and packet tunneling across nodes.

* **Translation Table:** Maintains the mapping of Service IPs to Instance IPs and their associated balancing policies for each service. For more details, refer to the [networking concepts](../networking) documentation.

* **Proxy Table:** Serves as a cache for active proxy translations.

* **MQTT Component:** Acts as the interface between the Net Manager and the Cluster Network Component. It resolves Service IP translation requests and retrieves the node's subnetwork during startup.

## Resilience and Failure Recovery

### Root Orchestrator Failure
A centralized control plane introduces a single point of failure. Oakestra mitigates this risk by enabling clusters to autonomously satisfy SLAs for deployed applications. Consequently, a Root Orchestrator failure impacts only the following:

- **Deployment of new applications:** System Manager APIs become unavailable, making it impossible to deploy new workloads.
- **Inter-cluster root discovery:** Pre-existing P2P communication between worker nodes remains unaffected, but new inter-cluster routes cannot be established.
- **Onboarding new clusters:** New clusters cannot join the infrastructure.

{{< callout context="note" icon="outline/info-circle">}}
A potential solution involves implementing leader election among cluster orchestrators to designate a new root, though this feature is not yet available in the current release.
{{< /callout >}}

<!-- The key drawback of a centralized control plane is that it represents a single point of failure. Oakestra mitigates this by ensuring that the clusters are able to satisfy the SLAs for deployed applications autonomously. Therefore, by design, a Root Orchestrator failure only affects the following orchestration aspects:
- Deployment of new applications. The system manager APIs are not available, and therefore, deploying new workloads is not possible.
- Inter-cluster root discovery. Pre-existing P2P worker node communication is not affected. However, new inter-cluster routes cannot be discovered. 
- New clusters cannot join the infrastructure. 

Solutions based on leader election for a new root among cluster orchestrators are a possible solution. However, this feature has not yet been implemented in the current release. -->

### Cluster Orchestrator Failure
<!-- The failure of a cluster orchestrator by design must not affect **(i)** other clusters **(ii)** running workloads on the workers. With the current design, a failure of the cluster orchestrator has the following consequences: 
- The cluster is not able to receive new workloads.
- The cluster is not able to connect new workers.
- The cluster is not able to reschedule failed workloads. 
- Inter-cluster network route discovery is not possible. Only pre-existing connections are maintained. -->

By design, a cluster orchestrator failure does not impact *(i)* other clusters or *(ii)* workloads already running on worker nodes. However, the following limitations arise:

- The cluster cannot accept new workloads.
- The cluster cannot onboard new worker nodes.
- The cluster cannot reschedule failed workloads.
- Inter-cluster route discovery is disabled, though pre-existing connections are preserved.

{{< callout context="note" icon="outline/info-circle">}}
Cluster and Root Orchestrator failures can be mitigated by deploying a high-availability setup for the control plane's microservices.
{{< /callout >}}

### Worker Node Failure
<!-- A worker node failure is common and expected at the edge. The cluster will re-deploy the workload affected by the worker failure. Worker failures are detected via a heartbeat mechanism. If a worker stops responding for more than 5 seconds, the cluster will scale up and re-deploy the workload on another worker. The worker node failure time threshold is a [parameter](https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra/blob/c0f3250ebdf8fbff5d35c1662e59cb1f4a8e899a/cluster_orchestrator/cluster-manager/cluster_manager.py#L52) of the cluster manager. -->


Worker node failures are common and expected in edge environments. The cluster handles such failures as follows:

- Workloads affected by the failure are automatically re-deployed on other worker nodes.
- Failures are detected using a heartbeat mechanism. If a worker node is unresponsive for more than **5 seconds**, the cluster scales up and reallocates the workload.

{{< callout context="note" icon="outline/info-circle">}}
The failure detection threshold is configurable and can be adjusted in the [cluster manager settings](https://github.com/oakestra/oakestra/blob/c0f3250ebdf8fbff5d35c1662e59cb1f4a8e899a/cluster_orchestrator/cluster-manager/cluster_manager.py#L52).
